My first repository on GitHub

My name is Nayla Kidd. I'm a sophomore undergraduate student at Columbia University's Engineering School. In my spare time, I love to populate my soundcloud playlists, dance to music with heavy beats, refine my make-up skills, and drink LOTS of water! I plan to be a computer science major with a minor in Economics. And I'm super excited to be in Bauer's Data Structures class! I hear he's a great professor, and I'm falling in love with Data Science. 

Til next time!
